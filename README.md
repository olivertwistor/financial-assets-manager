## Who is this for?
It can be difficult to keep track of all your financial assets, especially if you have a lot of different assets. It can also be difficult to track how your assets develop over time. This application may be of help for you if you like me wants the computer to keep track of these things for you.

## Prerequisites
This application is written in PHP and uses CodeIgniter as its framework. Thus, you will need:

* [PHP 7.2 or newer][6]
* a web server capable of running PHP, for example [Apache][1] or [IIS][4]
* a database driver such as *mysqli*, *postgre* and *sqlite3* (please refer to [CodeIgniter's server requirements][5] for information which database drivers are specifically supported)
