## Background
One of my many interests is financial investing. I have been doing it since 
1995. For many years I have managed my various assets in a Microsoft Excel 
file, but it has gotten quite unwieldly and despite Excel being a very good 
program, it has certain limitations.

## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to help the user keeping track of their 
financial assets over time, and both give overview and detailed view of their 
historical and current holdings.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to make an application written in PHP that:

* lets the user list all their financial assets and their current value over 
time
* lets the user sort their assets in a hierarchy that allows for different 
levels of detail when they want to view them (for example view individual stock 
versus view all stocks combined)

## Stakeholders
The primary stakeholders of Financial Assets Manager would be people who want 
support for keeping track of their financial assets.
